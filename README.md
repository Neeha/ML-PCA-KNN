Principal Component Analysis on MNIST

Using principal component analysis (PCA), to project images on a reduced eigen space and using k-nearest neighbours model to see the features captured by the projections. Eigen vectors are computed for the training images, top n eigen vectors are considered as the principal components and the model is tested on the reduced eigen space. From the projected space, few images were projected back to their original size to be reconstructed.
